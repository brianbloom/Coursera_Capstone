# Capstone Project Proposal: Battle of the Neighborhoods

## Introduction / Problem to Solve
While there are quite a number of fictional business problems I could solve, I have a more immediate personal one that is of interest to solve.
I have just returned from living in the Netherlands for the last 3 years, and am staying at my father's house near Austin, Texas, as temporary lodging.
As a soon-to-be-certified data science geek, I would like to leverage my newly found data skills to help inform where I should look for a place to live in Austin that best suits me and my family.
A realtor can provide me with nearly unlimited options that are for sale or rent, but would benefit from limiting that search to a specific subset of zipcodes or neighborhoods.
So my plan is to "connect the dots" with relevant available location data to help with that search.

## Criteria:
My family would like to find a place that maximizes our different needs. To that end, I will need to pull together several datasets to find an optimal area of Austin to look for housing in. *(Each of these are described in much more detail in the data section)* For my daughter I am interested in places close to swimming pools.  For my wife, we want places with good public transit options. For all of us, we need to obviously only consider places that we can afford. And finally, we'd really like places that have two of our favorite foods nearby: sushi, and pizza, and will weight those places higher.

## Deliverable
Using the datasets specified, I will construct a "heatmap" of the places that are most optimal for us, as well as a "top 5" list of zipcodes that we can give to a realtor to help us find a place to live that most adequately meets our needs.
